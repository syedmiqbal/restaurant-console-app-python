# restaurant-console-app-python
This was a Python class assignment from my instructor Mr.Shakaib to use Python's OOPs concepts
The objective was to build a basic console application using Python's builtin tools
and applying basic OOPs concepts mainly Inheritance

Objectives:
The app was required to show a menu to the user to show all available items
The user will enter name of required item followed by required order qty of that item
The menu again prompts user to either further items or press 'x' to quit the ordering menu
Once the user is done with ordering his/her food items, the next screen
shows the user receipt of the ordered items and total value of the order.
